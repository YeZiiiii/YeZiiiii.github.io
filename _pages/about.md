I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/), [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, deep learning, and human-computer interaction.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Chen Ye](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/info/1379/11357.htm) of 209 Lab from [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/), Tongji University.
